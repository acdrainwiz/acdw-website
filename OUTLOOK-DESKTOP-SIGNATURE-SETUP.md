## Step 4: Paste Your Signature

### Method 1: Using Source/HTML View (Recommended)
1. In the signature editor, look for one of these buttons:
   - **"Source"** button
   - **"</>"** (HTML icon)
   - **"HTML"** button
   - Or right-click in the editor and look for **"View Source"** or **"Edit HTML"**
2. Click the button to switch to HTML/Source view
3. **Delete any existing content** in the editor
4. Paste your copied signature (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)
5. Click the Source/HTML button again to see the preview
6. Verify the signature looks correct

### Method 2: Direct Paste (If Source View Not Available)
1. Click in the signature editor area
2. Paste your copied signature (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)
3. The signature should paste as formatted HTML
4. If it shows as code, try Method 1 instead

## Step 5: Set as Default Signature

1. Under **"Choose default signature"** section:
   - **New messages:** Select your signature from the dropdown
   - **Replies/forwards:** Select your signature from the dropdown (optional)
2. Click **OK** to save

## Step 6: Test Your Signature

1. Create a new email message
2. Your signature should automatically appear
3. Verify:
   - Logo displays correctly
   - All text is formatted properly
   - Links work (email and website)
   - Colors and spacing look correct

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Showing?
- Make sure you're connected to the internet
- The logo loads from `https://acdrainwiz.com/images/ac-drain-wiz-logo-signature.png`
- If it still doesn't show, try refreshing Outlook or restarting the application

### Signature Shows as Code Instead of Formatted?
- Use Method 1 (Source/HTML view) to paste the signature
- Make sure you're pasting the copied HTML, not typing it manually

### Formatting Looks Wrong?
- Try using the Source/HTML view method
- Make sure you deleted all existing content before pasting
- If issues persist, try copying from the signature generator again

### Can't Find Source/HTML Button?
- Some Outlook versions hide this option
- Try right-clicking in the editor area
- Or use Method 2 (direct paste) - it should work in most cases

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Try copying the signature from the generator again
2. Make sure all required fields are filled in
