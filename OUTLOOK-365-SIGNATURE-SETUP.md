# How to Add/Update Your Email Signature in Outlook 365 (Web)

Follow these steps to add or update your email signature in Outlook 365 (the web-based version).

## Step 1: Generate Your Signature

2. Fill in all the required fields:
   - **Full Name** (required)
   - **Job Title** (required)
   - **Role/Department** (required) - Select from dropdown or choose "Custom"
   - **Mobile Phone** (optional) - Will auto-format as you type
   - **Email Address** (required)
3. Review the preview to make sure everything looks correct
4. Click **"Copy Signature to Clipboard"**
   - If you see validation errors, fix them first before copying

## Step 2: Open Outlook 365

1. Go to **https://outlook.office.com** (or your organization's Office 365 portal)
2. Sign in with your work email and password
3. Click on **Mail** if you're not already in the mail view

## Step 3: Access Signature Settings

1. Click the **Settings** icon (gear icon) in the top right corner
2. In the Settings panel, type **"signature"** in the search box
3. Click on **"Email signature"** from the search results
   - Or navigate to: **Settings** → **Mail** → **Compose and reply** → **Email signature**

## Step 4: Create or Edit Your Signature

### Creating a New Signature:
1. You'll see a text editor box for your email signature
2. If there's existing content, select all and delete it (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A, then Delete)

### Editing an Existing Signature:
1. Select all existing content in the signature editor
2. Delete it (or just click and start typing)

## Step 5: Paste Your Signature

### Method 1: Using HTML Source View (Recommended)
1. In the signature editor, look for formatting toolbar buttons
2. Find and click the **"</>"** (code/HTML) button or **"Source"** button
   - This may be in a "..." menu or toolbar dropdown
3. **Delete any existing content** in the HTML view
4. Paste your copied signature (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)
5. Click the HTML/Source button again to return to visual view
6. Verify the signature looks correct

### Method 2: Direct Paste (If HTML View Not Available)
1. Click in the signature editor area
2. Paste your copied signature (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)
3. The signature should paste as formatted HTML
4. If it shows as code, try Method 1 instead

### Method 3: Using Browser Developer Tools (Advanced)
If the above methods don't work:
1. Right-click in the signature editor
2. Select **"Inspect"** or **"Inspect Element"**
3. Look for the editor's content area in the HTML
4. Find the `<div>` or textarea element that contains the signature
5. Right-click it and select **"Edit as HTML"**
6. Paste your signature HTML
7. Click outside the developer tools to close them

## Step 6: Configure Signature Settings

1. **Automatically include my signature on new messages I compose:**
   - Check this box if you want the signature on all new emails
   
2. **Automatically include my signature on messages I forward or reply to:**
   - Check this box if you want the signature on replies/forwards (optional)

3. Click **Save** at the top of the Settings panel

## Step 7: Test Your Signature

1. Click **New message** to create a new email
2. Your signature should automatically appear (if you enabled auto-include)
3. Or manually insert it: Click the **"..."** menu in the compose window → **"Insert signature"**
4. Verify:
   - Logo displays correctly
   - All text is formatted properly
   - Links work (email and website)
   - Colors and spacing look correct

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Showing?
- Make sure you're connected to the internet
- The logo loads from `https://acdrainwiz.com/images/ac-drain-wiz-logo-signature.png`
- Some email clients block external images - recipients may need to "Download images" or "Show images"
- Try refreshing the page or clearing browser cache

### Signature Shows as Code Instead of Formatted?
- Use Method 1 (HTML/Source view) to paste the signature
- Make sure you're pasting the copied HTML, not typing it manually
- Try Method 3 (Developer Tools) if available

### Formatting Looks Wrong?
- Try using the HTML/Source view method
- Make sure you deleted all existing content before pasting
- Outlook 365 may strip some formatting - this is normal for web-based email
- If issues persist, try copying from the signature generator again

### Can't Find HTML/Source Button?
- Outlook 365's interface varies by organization
- Try Method 2 (direct paste) - it should work in most cases
- Or use Method 3 (Developer Tools) for more control

### Signature Not Appearing Automatically?
- Check your signature settings (Step 6)
- Make sure "Automatically include my signature" is checked
- Try manually inserting it using the "Insert signature" option

## Browser-Specific Notes

### Chrome/Edge:
- HTML view is usually available in the formatting toolbar
- Developer Tools (F12) work well for Method 3

### Firefox:
- Similar to Chrome, HTML view should be available
- Developer Tools work the same way

### Safari:
- May have limited HTML editing options
- Try direct paste method first
- Developer Tools available but may work differently

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Try copying the signature from the generator again
2. Make sure all required fields are filled in
3. Try a different browser (Chrome or Edge usually work best)
4. Contact IT support or your team lead
